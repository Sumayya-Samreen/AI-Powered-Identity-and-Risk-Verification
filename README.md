# AI-Powered Identity and Risk Verification

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered face recognition system built in Python using OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library.
It contains two main functionalities:

1. **Face Matching (`main.py`)** – Compares a test image with a reference image to determine if they match.
2. **Attendance System (`attendance.py`)** – Detects faces in real-time via webcam and marks attendance for recognized faces.

This project can be useful for secure identity verification, automated attendance tracking, and face-based access control systems.

## Features
- Real-Time Face Recognition using webcam feed.
- Image-to-Image Face Matching for identity verification.
- Multiple Faces Handling for attendance.
- Relative File Paths for portability.
- Encoding Known Faces once for efficiency.
- Lightweight & Fast using optimized face recognition methods.

## Suggested Future Improvements
- Attendance Logs – Save attendance records to a CSV file.
- Snapshot Capture – Automatically capture images for unknown faces.
- Security Features – Add authentication and encryption.
- Performance Optimization – Use GPU acceleration.
- Web Interface – Create a dashboard.
- Mobile Integration.

## Troubleshooting
- Camera Not Working: Try changing camera index in `cv2.VideoCapture()`.
- Missing Modules: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Face Recognition Errors: Ensure clear, frontal face images.

## Pro Tip for Recruiters / Collaborators
This project demonstrates a complete AI workflow for face detection, real-time recognition, and identity verification, serving as a robust example of computer vision applications in attendance tracking and security systems.
